I have used Tableau to create a dashboard using the 2014 Queensland NAPLAN data from the Australian government website. NAPLAN is the National Assessment Program -A series of tests focused on basic skills that are administered to Australian students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9.  Using this data I created a useful and informative dashboard for international and Australian teachers seeking a teaching job in Queensland. Using the dashboard, they can investigate, compare and gain insight into different schools within Queensland and identify which schools are best suited for them to apply to. Project completed using Tableau.
