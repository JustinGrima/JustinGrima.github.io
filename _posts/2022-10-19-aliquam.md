Performance.

Student academic success and overall school performance have been found to have a correlation with
their parent's level of education. This report is an analysis of the “Student Performance Data Set”1 (“UCI 
Machine Learning Repository: Student Performance Data Set,”) 2014 to address if a higher combined parent
educational level correlates to greater student academic success. The purpose of this report is to i) classify 
parents' combined education levels (PCEL), ii) analyse students' academic performances based on their parent's 
combined education level and iii) investigate other variables that could influence students' academic
performance based on their parent's combined education level. The methodological approach uses the program 
RStudio to conduct data cleaning, manipulation, representation, summarization, and visualisation using various 
packages such as ggplot2, tidyverse, and dplyr, on the data set named ‘Student Performance Data Set from ‘UCI 
Machine Learning Repository’. This CSV file tabulates “student achievement in secondary education of two 
Portuguese schools”1 (“UCI Machine Learning Repository: Student Performance Data Set,” 2014) in both 
mathematics and Portuguese subjects during 2014.
