Heart Failure (HF) has been a prevalent global pandemic for years, in 2014 “approximately 26 million people worldwide were living with heart failure”1 (Ponikowski et al., 2014) with this number only increasing in our present day. To help improve these statistics, predictive models for this disease can provide a key approach to decreasing its impact. The purpose of this report aims to analyse the “DataClean-fullage"2 (Coronary Artery Disease - Analysis, n.d.) dataset and i) use supervised machine learning algorithms to create predictive models for heart failure, ii) create unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyse and discover interesting natural cluster patternsin the response variable; heart failure and iii) use association rule mining to find a list of established association rules for heart failure and its possible association with other medical conditions within the dataset. The methodological approaches use the program RStudio to conduct data cleaning, 
manipulation, supervised (Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression), unsupervised (Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) and DBSCAN), and descriptive (Association Rule Mining) algorithms, summarizations, and visualisations; using various packages such as ‘cluster’, ‘naivebayes’, ‘MASS’, ‘ROCR’ and ‘arules’ to conduct on the data set ‘DataClean-fullage’ to investigate the topic of heart failure.
