In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, the exponential growth of big data has become a challenge for organizations, prompting a reevaluation of traditional monolithic data architectures. The paper delves into the innovative architectural paradigm of Data Mesh, which offers a potential solution by introducing a decentralized, domain-oriented strategy for data management. By prioritizing self-service data practices and streamlined processes, Data Mesh aims to empower organizations to utilize their investments in Big Data and AI, fostering a culture deeply rooted in data-driven decision-making. Drawing insights from diverse sources, the review comprehensively explores prevailing data architectures, outlines challenges, thoroughly analyzes the Data Mesh model, and theorizes the role of data scientists within it, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the discourse surrounding this transformative concept.
