		<h3><u><b>Data Scientist at ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies</b></u></h3>
		<p>Through my internship, I contributed to Joshua Cinner's project on global coral reef research, leading global research aimed at providing crucial scientific knowledge to support coral reef ecosystem services. As a data scientist, my role encompassed a range of key activities:

1. I conducted descriptive explorations and statistical analyses on numerous datasets in RStudio, ensuring adherence to the standards set by the MERMAID database. This involved tasks like verifying correct data formatting (e.g., dates, expedition depth), ensuring accurate fish species categorization (Genus and Species), and confirming scientists' contact details. Once validated, the data was integrated into the extensive MERMAID coral reef database.

2. Following the upload of data into the MERMAID database from RStudio, I further validated it following database standards. This process included addressing flagged fish characteristics errors, such as fish size and location anomalies. To rectify these issues, I cross-referenced information with 'fishbase.se' and 'marinespecies.org'. Any errors were either corrected or verified through communication with the responsible scientist. This process ensured the accuracy of the dataset before its official implementation.

3. I collaborated with the team to develop a 'golden data template' for scientists to use when recording their expedition data on coral reefs. This template would be sent to scientist to fill out based on their expedition and submit to the project team for us to validate and integrate into the database. It entailed discussions on selecting appropriate variables, establishing proper formatting, creating Metadata for clarity, and implementing popup tooltips to guide accurate data entry.

4. I addressed inquiries related to data from project team members, providing support in various data-related tasks. This encompassed discussions such as handling missing data in datasets and assisting team members in extracting and reformatting data from sources like 'fishbase.se' and 'marinespecies.org' to align with their specific standards.

Overall, this internship provided an exhilarating and challenging experience. It offered valuable real-world exposure and deepened my understanding of the responsibilities I can anticipate as a future data scientist in my career.
