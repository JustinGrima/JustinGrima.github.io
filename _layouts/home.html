                <p>Teacher, tech builder, global citizen and more, I have had the privilege of interacting with some amazing people and mentors. I have worked in different settings on many diverse projects, taking away valuable skills and life lessons. This has made me measure and define success in many ways, demonstrate leadership and adapt readily to different work environments and living conditions.
I have recently narrowed my focus to machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science. Combining my interests in coding, computer science and analytics I am excited and eager to continue my journey as a Data Scientist as I begin my second year of studies at James Cook University in the Master of Data Science program. I look forward to building a career that I believe will be intellectually challenging and provide me with exciting opportunities for a successful and rewarding career.
My prior experiences and maturity gained through years of working in various settings have prepared me for this new path. I am passionate, driven and intellectually capable, prepared to work hard to make significant and real contributions to this rapidly evolving discipline.
I look forward to future job opportunities that will help expand my skills and knowledge base and apply these to solve both simple and complex problems. Click the tab to view my projects or use the menu on the top right to explore more! </p>
